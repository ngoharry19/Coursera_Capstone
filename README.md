I also made a follow-up for my capstone project, which focuses on food venues in Sydney:
- [Clustering_Food_Venues_in_Sydney.ipynb](https://github.com/ngoharry19/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/Clustering_Food_Venues_in_Sydney.ipynb)

[sydney_trains.csv](https://github.com/ngoharry19/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/sydney_trains.csv) containing all Sydney Metro stations and their respective locations in latitude and longitude.
